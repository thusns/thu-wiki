# THU Wiki Project

Welcome, this is the source code repo of the [THU Wiki](https://thu.wiki).

We are the tech group members from the Students Network Service Team of Tsinghua University, aiming to build a useful and easy-to-use wiki for the students and teachers of Tsinghua University. We are also trying to make it a platform for students to share their knowledge and experience.

## Deploy Your Own

This project is based on [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. You can use the repo to try out and contribute to the wiki.

### Deploy on Vercel

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy the THU Wiki.
Our deployment is also running on Vercel. You can deploy your own THU Wiki with Vercel by clicking the button below.
